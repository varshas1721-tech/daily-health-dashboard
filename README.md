# 🩺 Daily Health Dashboard

This is a beginner-friendly health tracking web app I built using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps users track their daily hydration, steps, and nutrition goals—all in one clean dashboard. I created this project as part of my placement preparation and to improve my practical coding skills.
